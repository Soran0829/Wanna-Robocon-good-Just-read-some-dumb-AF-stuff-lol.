# How to Deal With Your Crew

## The Lowdown

Basically, you got three kinds of peeps in any tech club:

-   **The Grinder:** The go-getter who's all about leveling up their skills and always hits their deadlines. A real one.
-   **The 9-to-5er:** Does the work you give 'em, but that's it. Don't expect any extra credit.
-   **The Slacker:** Doesn't even do the work they're given. Just a freeloader, tbh.

Sounds harsh, but it is what it is. Let's break down how a manager should handle each type.

### The Grinder

These folks are self-starters and will grind hard, but they'll burn out if you just leave 'em be。
Hit 'em up on Discord or slide 'em a drink once in a while。 It'll boost their morale and keep 'em from crashing。
But yo, don't be too clingy。
They live for the grind, and if you get in their way too much, they'll just stress out and pull endless all-nighters。 Not a good look。
A simple "Yo, how's it hangin'?" is plenty。

### The 9-to-5er

First, the ground rules:
-   When they're done with a task, don't just dump random chores on them。 Ask, don't demand。
-   Give 'em a low-key nudge to keep the pace up。
These two things are key。

They're pretty reliable when you assign them something。
But if they've got too much downtime, they'll probably ghost the club。 So, keep a steady flow of tasks coming their way with some chill deadlines。

If they wrap up early, you can line up more work for them。 Sync up with the team leads to keep the workflow smooth。

### The Slacker

## TL;DR: Don't give them work。

They've got zero skills, period。
They have no drive to get better and will blow past every deadline, so it's pointless。
That's it。 Just let them vibe。

But hey, sometimes you find a diamond in the rough。 If you can afford to take a hit, tossing them a low-stakes task might not be the worst idea。

Here's a little nugget of wisdom to live by:

Psychology says the moment a "hard worker" breaks is when they see a "slacker" getting props for doing nothing。
